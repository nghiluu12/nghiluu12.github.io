## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2, part 1
This was a favorite because it was one of my first interactions with C++ and I enjoyed creating a Mad Libs-style program that used user input to generate funny paragraphs. I learned how to declare and use std::string variables and how to prompt the user for input with std::cout and std::cin. I also learned about proper C++ formatting, including line wrapping and aligning operators, which made my code cleaner and easier to read.

Lab 10, part 1
This lab was a favorite because I enjoyed organizing California’s county populations using 2D vectors and learning how to access and manipulate structured data. I learned how to write functions to search for a county, calculate the state population, and handle errors when a county isn’t found. I also gained experience with modular programming, splitting the program into multiple files, and using unit tests to verify that my functions worked correctly.

Lab 6, part 2
This lab was a favorite because I enjoyed writing functions to calculate the score of a Blackjack hand and handle different card types like aces, face cards, and number cards. It was difficult because I had to work on my own, but even though I didn’t get graded for this lab, I still enjoyed the challenge and learning from it. I learned how to validate user input from the command line and use conditional statements to calculate scores correctly, including the special rules for aces, and I practiced organizing my code into multiple functions.
